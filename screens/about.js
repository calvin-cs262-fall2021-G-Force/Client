        Knight Bites serves Calvin University students who, after the pandemic,
        wish to create meaningful connections with other Calvin University
        students and become more comfortable with the Grand Rapids community. It
        is a meet-up app that connects students through shared meals at
        restaurants that Calvin University is affiliated with, and, unlike
        tinder or other apps geared towards meet-ups, allows students to
        purchase these meals at a discounted price. The discounts are provided
        by Calvin University Student Senate. The Senate team has access to 10 -
        15% discounts on purchases from almost 20 restaurants that are within a
        4-mile radius of Calvin University! These restaurants are an integral
        part of the Calvin University student experience because they provide
        wonderful study spaces, amazing opportunities for connection, and of
        course, exquisite 5-star meals. College can be a difficult experience
        for students to adapt to, and meaningful interactions can be more
        difficult to come by. It is our belief as the KnightBites team that
        meals can be an excellent way to fostering discussion and relationships
        between anyone. Additionally, due to the nature of meet up apps, it can
        engage people with the culture of Grand Rapids as they enjoy meals.
